# Flowmo (In Progress): A Distributed Task and Workflow Engine

A scalable backend system for workflow automation using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis. Implemented asynchronous task queues with parallel workers, retry logic, and failure handling for long-running jobs. Implemented JWT-based authentication, task scheduling, and execution state tracking. Dockerized services to ensure environment consistency and deployment readiness. Focused on system reliability, concurrency, and scalability, similar to production backend systems.
